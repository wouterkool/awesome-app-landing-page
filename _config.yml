  SET Finder will recognize SET cards on your picture and let you know if there is a SET! Now you finally have a way to check that there really is no SET before you draw additional cards!

  Up for a challenge? Draw some cards, let SET Finder tell you how many SETs there are and see if you can find them all!

  If you just need a little help, SET Finder can show you all SETs by letting you swipe through them!
